Bangladeshi Currency Detection With MaskRCNN

There is a total number of 100 currency images in the dataset which I scrap own captured Image. 90 images are used for training and 10 images are used for validation.

I used VGG Image Annotator to annotate the training and validation images.

Feel free to use the dataset and modify the code. The original code is adopted from mattport's Mask-RCNN repo.
